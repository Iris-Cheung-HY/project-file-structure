# Goal
This project is a simple calculator that demonstrates modular programming and unit testing. It provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and includes tests for each operation.

# addition.py
contains a function for adding two numbers.

# subtraction.py
contains a function for subtracting one number from another.


# multiplication.py
contains a function for multiplying two numbers.


# division.py
contains a function for dividing one number by another (with division-by-zero handling).

# tests
For each arithmetic module, there is a corresponding test file inside the tests/ folder:
test_addition.py → tests the addition.py module
test_subtraction.py → tests the subtraction.py module
test_multiplication.py → tests the multiplication.py module
test_division.py → tests the division.py module
Run all tests with:
